PRACTICAL WORK II

The idea of this project was to create a web inspired in astronomy.Also to create a web to connect into the net so you can check other people works.

During this project I had a lot of problems, I had a lot of issues creating a header with borders and insert images in it. I also had a lot of problems with the style css because if i changed something to improve one thing it dealed into 5 new problems...
I couldn't solve a problem with the index image so I'm very frustrated with it because the home page looks empty without it.

In conclussion I have learned a lot during this project, I learned to solve different problems and I have discovered an interesting field of programming.
