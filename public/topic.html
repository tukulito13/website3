                A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and
                dark matter bound together by gravity. The word is derived from the Greek
                galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that
                contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 billion stars,
                range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest
                galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its 
                galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of 
                dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars 
                and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.
                <br><br>
                Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, 
                spiral, or irregular.Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their
                centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass 
                four million times greater than the Sun.
                <br><br>
                It is estimated that there are between 200 billion(2×1011) to 2 trillion 
                galaxies in the observable universe. Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs
                in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by
                distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison
                , the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is
                separated from the Andromeda Galaxy (with diameter of about 152,000 ly), its 
                nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)
